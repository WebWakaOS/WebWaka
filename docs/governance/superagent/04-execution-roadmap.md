# WebWaka SuperAgent — Consolidated Execution Roadmap (12–24 Months)

**Status:** APPROVED — New Source of Truth for all AI and SuperAgent timelines  
**Date:** 2026-04-09  
**Merges:** M8-AI Phase Plan (M8a-AI-1–4) into SuperAgent phased structure  
**Authority:** Overrides all previous AI implementation timelines in isolation  

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Position Statement:**  
> WebWaka SuperAgent is the **cross-cutting intelligence layer** — it is NOT a fourth platform pillar.  
> This roadmap schedules SA work that enhances Pillar 1 (Ops), Pillar 2 (Branding), and Pillar 3 (Marketplace).  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map.

---

## Roadmap Governance Rules

1. **This roadmap is the single source of truth** for all AI and SuperAgent implementation work
2. All M8-AI-1–4 tasks from `docs/implementation/m8-ai-phase-plan.md` are merged below — that document is now a **Phase 1 dependency detail**, not a parallel plan
3. All M8b–M8e vertical AI tasks reference this roadmap for ordering
4. Any new AI feature must be placed in a phase of this roadmap before implementation begins
5. Outdated AI timelines in individual vertical framework docs are superseded by this document
