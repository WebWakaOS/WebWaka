# WebWaka SuperAgent — Document Update Plan

**Status:** APPROVED — Authoritative list of all files requiring update for SuperAgent alignment  
**Date:** 2026-04-09  
**Authority:** Extends `docs/governance/superagent/01-synthesis-report.md`  
**Rule:** No agent may implement AI features until all Phase 1 document updates below are complete  

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Position Statement:**  
> WebWaka SuperAgent is the **cross-cutting intelligence layer** — it is NOT a fourth platform pillar.  
> SuperAgent enhances Pillar 1 (Ops), Pillar 2 (Branding), and Pillar 3 (Marketplace) but does not constitute an independent product surface.  
> All AI capabilities are exposed through the UI of one of the three pillars.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map.

## Phase 1 Updates (Must Complete Before Any Implementation)

### DOC-001 — `docs/governance/ai-platform-master-plan.md`

**Owner:** Platform team  
**Priority:** P0 — blocks all implementation  
**Status:** ✅ DONE — 2026-04-13

| Section | What to Change |
|---|---|
| §2 (User/Admin/Provider Hierarchy) | Add "SuperAgent Layer" between Super Admin and Workspace Admin. Show SuperAgent key issuance flow |
| §5 (Billing — Funding Sources) | Level 3 ("Platform key") now means "SuperAgent managed key backed by aggregator pool". Not a direct vendor key |
| §6 (BYOK Policy) | Add: "When AI is enabled, a SuperAgent managed key is auto-issued as the default BYOK. User-supplied BYOK keys override the managed key" |
| §9 (Model Routing — Aggregator Strategy) | Expand OpenRouter from "recommended" to "primary platform aggregator". Add Together, Groq, Eden AI as co-aggregators |
| New §12 | Add: "WebWaka SuperAgent" — brief description pointing to `docs/governance/superagent/` suite |

## Instructions for Future Implementation Agents

When you are about to implement any AI feature:

1. **Check phase** — which phase does this feature belong to per `04-execution-roadmap.md`?
2. **Verify Phase N documents** — all docs tagged "Before Phase N" must have ✅ status in this file
3. **If a doc is not updated** — update it yourself as the first task, then implement the feature
4. **Never implement using outdated plans** — if this document says a file needs to change, that file's content cannot be treated as authoritative until changed
5. **After implementing** — update `04-execution-roadmap.md` acceptance criteria checkboxes
6. **Online research** — before implementing any provider integration, search for current API documentation and pricing for that aggregator; aggregator APIs and pricing evolve frequently

---

## Conflict Resolution Rule

If any document contradicts the SuperAgent plan:

> **The SuperAgent plan wins.**  
> Update the contradicting document. Flag the conflict in a code comment or PR description.  
> Do not assume the older document is correct.  
> If genuinely ambiguous, escalate to the platform team before implementing.
