# Release Governance

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** Base44 Super Agent (draft) → Founder (approval)
**Last updated:** 2026-04-07

---

## Purpose

This document defines the rules for promoting code from development to staging to production. No exceptions without explicit Founder approval.

---

## Environments

| Environment | Branch | URL Pattern | Deployment Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | `feat/*`, `fix/*` | Local / Wrangler dev | Manual |
| Staging | `staging` | `staging.webwaka.com` (or workers.dev) | Auto on merge to `staging` |
| Production | `main` | `app.webwaka.com` | Auto on merge to `main` |

---

## Promotion Flow

```
feat/* or fix/* branch
  ↓ PR to staging (CI must pass, 1 review required)
  ↓ Merge to staging
  ↓ Automated deploy to Cloudflare staging
  ↓ QA verification (Base44 runs governance checks)
  ↓ Founder staging signoff (required)
  ↓ PR from staging → main (no additional code changes allowed)
  ↓ Merge to main
  ↓ Automated deploy to Cloudflare production
```

---

## Rules

### Staging Promotion Rules
1. All CI checks must pass (typecheck, test, lint, security audit).
2. At least 1 reviewer must approve the PR.
3. No unresolved review comments.
4. PR description must reference the milestone and related issues.
5. No direct pushes to `staging` (exception: Base44 automation with PAT for infrastructure-only files — must be documented).

### Production Promotion Rules
1. All staging rules apply.
2. **Founder must explicitly sign off on staging before a PR to `main` is opened.**
3. The staging → main PR must be a clean merge with no cherry-picks or manual rebases.
4. Production deployment must be observed and confirmed within 30 minutes.
5. Post-deploy smoke test must pass (see `tests/smoke/`).

---

## Rollback Policy

### Code Rollback
- Revert the merge commit on `main` (`git revert -m 1 <merge-sha>`).
- Push to `main` — CI will automatically redeploy the previous version.
- Rollback must be announced in the incident channel.

### Database Rollback
- Every D1 migration in `infra/cloudflare/migrations/` must include a corresponding rollback script.
- Naming convention: `NNNN_description.sql` (forward) and `NNNN_description.rollback.sql` (reverse).
- Rollback is applied manually using `wrangler d1 execute`.
- **No migration may drop a column or table in the same release it was first added.** Add → use → drop across separate releases.

---

## Versioning

- Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **MAJOR:** breaking changes (schema changes affecting existing tenants, API contract changes)
- **MINOR:** new features, new packages, new endpoints
- **PATCH:** bug fixes, performance improvements, doc updates
- Every production release is tagged: `v1.2.3`
- Changelog maintained manually in `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format
- Every PR must update CHANGELOG.md with changes being introduced

---

## Approval Matrix

| Action | Approver |
|---|---|
| Merge feat to staging | 1 reviewer (any) |
| Merge staging to main | Founder signoff required |
| Emergency hotfix to main | Founder verbal + Base44 executes |
| Rollback production | Base44 executes, Founder notified immediately |
| Schema migration to production | Founder must review migration script |

---

## Milestone Release Criteria

Before a milestone is marked DONE and promoted to `main`:
- [ ] All milestone tasks completed and verified
- [ ] CI passes on `staging`
- [ ] Governance alignment verified by Base44
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified
- [ ] Entitlement enforcement verified
- [ ] Geography correctness verified
- [ ] Mobile QA passed
- [ ] Staging smoke tests pass
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Founder signoff received

## Current Development Workflow

Development currently uses Replit Agent as the primary implementation engine, with code pushed to GitHub via the GitHub API (PAT-authenticated). The Replit environment serves as the development and testing workspace.

### Push Flow
1. Replit Agent implements features and fixes in the Replit workspace
2. Code is validated via typecheck and manual testing
3. Changes are pushed to GitHub via the API (blob → tree → commit → ref update)
4. CI runs on GitHub Actions (typecheck, test, lint, audit, governance checks)
5. PR opened from feature branch → staging
6. Staging verification → Founder signoff → staging → main

### Governance CI Gate
Every PR must pass the governance checks job, which validates:
- CORS configuration is production-safe
- Tenant isolation (no tenant_id from user input)
- No direct AI SDK calls (P7 — must use @webwaka/ai-adapters)
- Monetary integrity (P9 — no floats on monetary values)

### Secret Rotation
See `infra/cloudflare/secrets-rotation-log.md` for the full secret inventory and rotation schedule.
