# Agent Execution Rules

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** Perplexity (initial) + Base44 (refinement) → Founder (approval)
**Last updated:** 2026-04-07

## Purpose

This document defines how Replit Agent 4, Base44 Super Agent, and Perplexity must coordinate, hand off work, and operate within WebWaka OS. All agents must follow these rules.

---

## Pre-Implementation Rules (apply to all agents)

1. **Read `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` before starting any task.**
2. **Read all relevant TDRs** in `docs/architecture/decisions/` before implementing a feature.
3. **No implementation begins before the governance doc skeleton exists** (Milestone 1 must be complete before Milestone 2 starts).
4. **No vertical-specific code before the shared packages it depends on** are implemented.
5. **No undocumented infrastructure changes.** Every Cloudflare resource, GitHub secret, and environment variable must be documented in `infra/`.

---

## Replit Agent 4 Rules

- Is the primary implementation engine for all `packages/*` and `apps/*` code.
- Must produce typed, tested, governance-compliant code.
- Must follow the build order in the master build prompt exactly (Phase 1 → Phase 7).
- For every task, must report:
  - Files added or changed
  - Package boundaries respected
  - Tests added
  - Unresolved blockers
- Must not commit directly to `staging` or `main`. All code goes through PRs.
- Must not create new Cloudflare resources or GitHub secrets — that is Base44's responsibility.
- Must not invent architecture not present in governance docs — open an issue instead.

---

## Base44 Super Agent Rules

- Owns all infrastructure: GitHub repo, branches, protections, labels, workflows, Cloudflare Workers, D1, KV, R2, secrets.
- Owns the milestone tracker and continuity notes.
- Reviews all Replit outputs for governance compliance before marking milestones done.
- Must record every infrastructure resource it creates in `infra/cloudflare/` or `infra/github-actions/` — never assumes another agent knows the state.
- Must not implement business logic in `packages/` or `apps/` — that is Replit's responsibility.
- For every infrastructure change, must commit a record to the repo so the state is auditable.
- Leads staging hardening (Milestone 10) and production deployment control (Milestone 12).

---

## Perplexity Rules

- Drafts governance documents, TDRs, architecture specs, and implementation prompts.
- Does not push code or configure infrastructure directly.
- All drafts are submitted as files in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder.
- Must flag ambiguities or contradictions in governance docs as GitHub issues before Replit implements.

---

## Handoff Protocol

### Base44 → Replit handoff
Before Replit starts a milestone:
1. Base44 confirms the repo structure is in place.
2. Base44 confirms the relevant governance docs and TDRs are in `docs/`.
3. Base44 opens a GitHub issue for the milestone with the master build prompt as a comment.
4. Replit picks up the issue and begins implementation.

### Replit → Base44 handoff
After Replit completes implementation for a milestone:
1. Replit opens a PR to `staging` with full description.
2. Base44 reviews for governance compliance.
3. If compliant: Base44 approves and merges, then runs staging verification.
4. If not compliant: Base44 requests changes with specific governance references.

### Staging → Production handoff
1. Base44 runs full milestone release checklist (see `docs/governance/release-governance.md`).
2. Base44 notifies Founder with staging URL and checklist results.
3. Founder reviews and gives explicit go/no-go.
4. On go: Base44 merges staging → main.
5. On no-go: issues are filed and Replit fixes before re-verification.

---

## Blocking Rule

If any agent encounters a situation where proceeding would require:
- Violating a platform invariant
- Making an undocumented architecture decision
- Skipping a required governance document

**The agent must stop, open a GitHub issue with the `blocked` + `founder-approval` labels, and wait for resolution.**

---

## Continuity Rule

Everything must be written so another agent can resume seamlessly if interrupted:
- Code: typed, testable, commented
- Decisions: recorded in TDRs
- Infrastructure: documented in `infra/`
- Progress: updated in `docs/governance/milestone-tracker.md`
- Blockers: filed as GitHub issues

---

## Governance Enforcement

### CI Governance Checks (CI-001)
The following automated checks run on every PR via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- **check-cors.ts**: Validates CORS configuration is non-wildcard and excludes localhost in production
- **check-tenant-isolation.ts**: Scans route files for tenant_id sourced from user input instead of auth context
- **check-ai-direct-calls.ts**: Ensures no direct OpenAI/Anthropic SDK usage outside @webwaka/ai-adapters (P7)
- **check-monetary-integrity.ts**: Detects parseFloat/toFixed on monetary field names (P9)

### Release Changelog
Every PR must update `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root. See `docs/governance/release-governance.md` for full release flow.

### Secret Rotation
All secrets must be rotated every 90 days. See `infra/cloudflare/secrets-rotation-log.md` for the rotation schedule and procedures.
