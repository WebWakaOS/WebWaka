## Purpose

Claim-first onboarding allows WebWaka to seed discoverable records first and convert them into managed tenants later. This is the primary growth pattern for the platform.

## Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Seeded** | Record exists in discovery, not yet claimed |
| **Claimable** | Record is open for an owner to claim |
| **Claim Pending** | Claim request submitted, awaiting verification |
| **Verified** | Claim identity confirmed |
| **Managed** | Workspace activated, entity under active management |
| **Branded** | Brand Surface activated for the entity |
| **Monetized** | Offerings are live and transactional |
| **Delegated** | Partner or sub-partner is managing on behalf of entity |

## Enforcement

The claim lifecycle state machine is enforced by **`packages/claims/src/state-machine.ts`** (not `@packages/profiles`). The `@packages/profiles` package provides the `PublicProfile` data contract only.

**Implemented stages (all 8 in FSM):**
- Seeded → Claimable → Claim Pending → Verified → Managed → Branded → Monetized → Delegated

**Transition guards (implemented in `guardedAdvanceClaimState()`):**
- `managed → branded`: requires active Pillar 2 branding subscription (`hasBrandingSubscription`)
- `branded → monetized`: requires at least one payment method configured (`hasPaymentMethod`)
- `monetized → delegated`: requires signed partner delegation agreement (`hasDelegationAgreement`)

**Terminal state:** `delegated` — no further transitions allowed.

The FSM also supports skip transitions (e.g., `managed → monetized` directly) when all intermediate guards are satisfied.

**Test coverage:** 36 tests in `packages/claims/src/state-machine.test.ts` covering all transitions, guards, error classes, and edge cases.

## Rules

1. Seeded records may exist before a user signs up.
2. Claim rights must be auditable at every stage.
3. Sensitive sectors (political, regulated, healthcare) may require enhanced verification.
4. Claim completion does not bypass subscription rules.
5. Claiming should unlock the path to workspace activation but not automatically activate it.
