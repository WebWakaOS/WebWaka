  - Artisan catalogue template covers the widest range of informal economy businesses
  - P1-Original vertical — must ship before M10
  - High reuse: electricians, plumbers, carpenters, tailors, cobblers, mechanics all inherit this pattern

Pre-work checklist:
  [ ] Read pillar2-generic-implementation-prompt.md (mandatory)
  [ ] Confirm status is READY_FOR_RESEARCH in pillar2-niche-registry.json
  [ ] Claim niche (set status to RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS + set owner)
  [ ] Begin 4-thread parallel research

## Queue Rules

1. **Always work from the CURRENT niche first.** Never self-select a different niche without a documented reason.
2. **Only one niche may be IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS at a time** (per agent session).
3. **After completing a niche:** move it to the Completed table, advance CURRENT to the next unclaimed READY_FOR_RESEARCH niche.
4. **Batch 4 niches** may be implemented (the template code can be written) but cannot be marked SHIPPED until the slug mismatch remediation migration is confirmed applied.
5. **Queue order may be changed by a human platform owner only.** Agents do not reorder the queue.
6. **If the CURRENT niche is already IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS by another agent:** take the next available niche in the list.
