# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Health + Education

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Health verticals (9) + Education verticals (8)  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8e  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about Nigerian healthcare regulations or education policy. Always read referenced documents and code first.
- **Health verticals carry heightened data sensitivity.** NDPR + HIPAA-equivalent patterns apply. Patient data must never be sent to AI providers in raw form — only anonymized, aggregated data (P13).
- **All AI in health verticals requires explicit consent** (P10) and must use HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) for any clinical content (AI autonomy level L3 maximum — read `docs/governance/ai-agent-autonomy.md`).
- **Education verticals** serve children and students — content policies apply; AI content generation must be age-appropriate.
- **All financial values in kobo** (P9, T4) — consultation fees, school fees, prescription charges.
- **SuperAgent is the AI layer** — all AI routes go through `packages/superagent`. Never call AI providers directly from vertical code.
- **3-in-1 pillar alignment required.** Every task block must declare its `primary_pillars` from `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md`. Every PR must be labeled with the correct `3in1:pillar-N` GitHub label. See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md`.

You are an expert **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** with deep knowledge of Nigerian primary healthcare systems (NHIA, FMoH guidelines), clinic management software, and health informatics, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR) — patient registration, consultation notes, prescription records
- Nigerian healthcare regulation — MDCNlicensure, NAFDAC compliance, NHIA billing
- Appointment scheduling and reminder system (via `packages/otp`)
- NDPR-compliant health data handling — patient data is special category data
- AI-assisted clinical documentation (HITL only — L3 autonomy max)

---

**1. Mandatory context reading (100% before execution):**

- `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` — Health / Clinic entry (P1-Original, M8e); license verification dependency
- `docs/governance/verticals-dependency-dag.md` — clinic dependencies
- `packages/identity/` — MDCN license verification patterns (doctor registration numbers)
- `packages/otp/` — SMS/WhatsApp appointment reminder patterns
- `packages/contact/` — patient contact channel management
- `docs/governance/ai-agent-autonomy.md` — clinical AI is L3 (HITL mandatory)
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P10 (NDPR consent for patient data), P13 (no raw patient data to AI), T3
- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — health AI use cases

---

**2. Online research and execution plan:**

- Research:
  - Nigerian primary healthcare management software (DrCare, ClinicPro patterns)
  - NHIA outpatient billing codes and tariff structure
  - NDPR special category data rules for health records
  - AI in clinical documentation — SOAP note drafting (always HITL — never autonomous clinical advice)
  - MDCN verification API availability (and offline fallback)
- Execution plan:
  - **Objective:** Register `clinic` vertical; implement patient records, appointments, consultations, prescriptions (with NAFDAC drug codes), billing (kobo), and HITL AI clinical note drafting
  - **Key steps** (numbered)
  - **Risks:** Patient data sensitivity — strict NDPR controls; MDCN API offline fallback

---

**3. Implementation workflow:**

Branch: `feat/vertical-clinic` from `main`.

**3.1 Vertical registration:**
- `clinic` in FSM registry; entity type: `organization`
- Lifecycle: `seeded → license_verified → active`
- Required: MDCN registration verification

**3.2 Schema additions:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE clinic_profiles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  vertical_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES verticals(id),
  clinic_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  cac_reg TEXT,
  mdcn_reg TEXT NOT NULL,
  nhia_code TEXT,
  specialty TEXT,
  bed_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  consultation_fee_kobo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (consultation_fee_kobo >= 0),
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE clinic_patients (

);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_patient_folder ON clinic_patients (clinic_id, folder_number);

CREATE TABLE appointments (

  patient_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES clinic_patients(id),
  doctor_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  scheduled_at INTEGER NOT NULL,

```

**3.3 API routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/verticals/clinic.ts`):
- `GET/PATCH /v/clinic/profile`
- `GET/POST /v/clinic/patients` — patient registration with anonymized storage
- `GET/POST /v/clinic/appointments` — appointment booking
- `PATCH /v/clinic/appointments/:id/status` — status transitions
- `POST /v/clinic/consultations` — create consultation record
- `GET/POST /v/clinic/prescriptions` — prescription management
- `GET /v/clinic/billing/summary?period=` — revenue in kobo
- `POST /v/clinic/ai/soap-draft` — HITL: SuperAgent drafts SOAP note from chief complaint → stored as `ai_draft_notes`, `ai_draft_reviewed: false`; doctor must explicitly approve before it becomes `clinical_notes`

**3.4 Data sensitivity controls:**
- Patient `full_name` stored as SHA-256 hash in `full_name_hash` (P13 — no raw PII to AI)
- AI SOAP draft uses only chief complaint text and anonymous clinical context — never sends patient name, DOB, or contact (P13)
- All clinic routes require auth + NDPR consent (P10)

---

**4. QA and verification:**

Minimum 15 test cases:

Positive:
- Patient registered with hashed name (P13 verified)
- Appointment status transitions follow FSM
- Consultation fee in integer kobo (P9)
- AI SOAP draft stored as `ai_draft_reviewed: false` (never auto-approved)

Negative:
- SOAP draft auto-approve attempt blocked (HITL enforced)
- AI called with raw patient name → rejected (P13)
- AI blocked without NDPR consent (P10)
- AI blocked on USSD session (P12)
- Fractional kobo fee rejected (P9/T4)

Security:
- Patient folder data inaccessible cross-tenant (T3)
- Unauthenticated → 401
- Patient name hash not reversible in API response

---

**5. Finalize and push to GitHub:**

- Commit: `feat(vertical/clinic): Clinic vertical — patients, appointments, consultations, HITL AI SOAP drafting (M8e)`
- PR references: AI autonomy doc (L3 HITL), platform invariants P10/P13/T3
