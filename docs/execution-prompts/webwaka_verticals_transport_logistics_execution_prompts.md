# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Transport + Logistics

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Transport verticals (12) — Motor Park, Mass Transit, Rideshare, Haulage, NURTW, and related  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8c (all 4 P1-Original transport verticals)  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about Nigerian transport infrastructure. Always read the referenced documents and code first.
- **Research Nigerian transport context deeply** — FRSC regulations, NURTW structure, mass transit policy, and haulage licensing are domain-specific. Do not generalize from Western patterns.
- **All work must be pushed to GitHub.** No local partial work remains outside the repo.
- **SuperAgent is the AI layer** — all AI features route through `packages/superagent`. Never call AI providers directly.
- **3-in-1 pillar alignment required.** Every task block must declare its `primary_pillars` from `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md`. Every PR must be labeled with the correct `3in1:pillar-N` GitHub label. See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md`.
- **FRSC (Federal Road Safety Corps) integration** is a hard dependency for all transport verticals — vehicle registration, driver licensing, and route licensing require FRSC data. Read `packages/identity/` for integration patterns.
- **Platform Invariants:** P2 (Nigeria First), P9 (integer kobo for all fares and levies), T3 (tenant isolation), P12 (no AI on USSD — critical for roadside/motor park agents).

---

You are an expert **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** with deep knowledge of Nigerian motor park operations (NURTW/NUC structure, park fee collection, vehicle loading management), intercity bus terminals, and transport route management, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- Motor park management — bay/slot assignment, vehicle loading queues, departure scheduling
- NURTW/NUC compliance — union levy collection (kobo P9), membership management
- FRSC integration — vehicle plate verification, driver license checks via `packages/identity`
- Route management — origin, destination, waypoints, fare tables (kobo P9)
- AI-powered occupancy forecasting and dynamic fare suggestion (advisory only, not autonomous pricing)
- Offline-tolerant design — motor park agents often use USSD or feature phones (no AI on USSD paths P12)

---

**1. Mandatory context reading (100% before execution):**

- `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` — Transport / Motor Park entry (P1-Original, M8c); FRSC and geography dependencies
- `docs/governance/verticals-dependency-dag.md` — motor-park node, dependencies and blockers
- `packages/core/geography/` — state → LGA → ward hierarchy used for route origin/destination
- `packages/identity/` — FRSC vehicle registration and driver license verification (read all source files)
- `packages/payments/` — fare payment, levy collection via Paystack
- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — transport AI use cases (occupancy forecast, route optimization)
- `docs/governance/ai-capability-matrix.md` — capabilities for transport verticals
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P2, P9, P12, T3

---

**2. Online research and execution plan:**

- Research:
  - NURTW structure and park governance in Nigeria — chairman, secretary, financial secretary roles
  - FRSC vehicle registration database API patterns (if available) and offline fallback
  - Nigerian bus terminal operations — loading bay management, departure manifest
  - AI in transport — occupancy prediction, route demand forecasting
  - Offline-first patterns for field agents using USSD ticketing (note: USSD is AI-excluded, P12)
- Execution plan:
  - **Objective:** Register `motor-park` vertical; implement park profile, bay management, vehicle/driver registry with FRSC verification, departure scheduling, fare collection (kobo), levy management, and AI occupancy forecasting
  - **Key steps** (numbered)
  - **Risks:** FRSC API reliability (need offline fallback), NURTW compliance requirements vary by state

---

**4. QA and verification:**

Act as a **Senior QA Engineer** with transport and field operations testing experience.

**Test plan — minimum 16 test cases:**

Positive:
- Route created with fare in integer kobo (P9)
- Vehicle registered; FRSC verification status tracked
- Departure created, passenger count updated, fare total in kobo
- Levy recorded in integer kobo (P9)
- Daily report aggregates correctly across multiple departures

Negative:
- Fractional kobo fare rejected (P9/T4)
- Departure with unverified vehicle still allowed (warn, not block — per operational reality)
- Departure marked departed after already departed → 409 conflict

Security:
- AI occupancy forecast blocked on USSD session (P12)
- AI forecast blocked without NDPR consent (P10)
- Cross-park data inaccessible (T3)
- Unauthenticated → 401

Recovery:
- FRSC API unavailable → vehicle registered with `frsc_verified: false`; no crash
