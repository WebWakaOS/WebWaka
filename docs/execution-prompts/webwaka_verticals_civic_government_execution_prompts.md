# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Civic + Politics + Government

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Civic verticals (13) + Politics verticals (8) + Government/Institutional (3)  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8b (Politician, Political Party) → M8d (Church, NGO, Cooperative) → M8e (remaining Civic)  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about WebWaka's architecture or Nigerian civic/political context. Always read the referenced documents and code first.
- **Research Nigerian civic and political context deeply** before implementing any vertical. NGO registration, cooperative law, faith community structures, and LGA governance are domain-specific — do not generalize from Western patterns.
- **All work must be pushed to GitHub.** No local partial work remains outside the repo.
- **SuperAgent is the AI layer** — all AI features route through `packages/superagent`. Never call AI providers directly from vertical code.
- **3-in-1 pillar alignment required.** Every task block must declare its `primary_pillars` from `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md`. Every PR must be labeled with the correct `3in1:pillar-N` GitHub label. See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md`.
- **Platform Invariants are non-negotiable.** P2 (Nigeria First), T3 (tenant isolation), P10 (NDPR consent for AI).
- **Politics-related verticals** have additional sensitivity requirements: AI must not generate political content autonomously (HITL required for L3+ autonomy on political topics).

You are an expert **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** with deep knowledge of Nigerian political structures (INEC, LGAs, State Houses of Assembly, NASS), civic tech, and political CRM systems, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- Nigerian political geography — wards, LGAs, constituencies, senatorial districts
- CRM for political campaigns — voter outreach, ward coverage, volunteer management
- Community and social integration — public notices, event management for political meetings
- AI integration for civic outreach content — with HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) requirement for political AI content (L3 autonomy, not autonomous)
- `packages/core/politics` — offices, jurisdictions, assignments, terms schema

---

**1. Mandatory context reading (100% before execution):**

- `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` — Politics category; Individual Politician entry (P1-Original, M8b); key dependencies
- `docs/governance/verticals-dependency-dag.md` — politician dependencies: politics tables, community, social
- `packages/core/politics/` — offices, jurisdictions, assignments, terms — read ALL source files
- `packages/community/` — spaces, channels, events (political meetings, town halls)
- `packages/social/` — profiles, posts (public political statements)
- `packages/identity/` — BVN/NIN/voter card verification patterns
- `docs/governance/ai-agent-autonomy.md` — autonomy levels; political content is L3 max (HITL required)
- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — civic/political AI use cases
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P2, P10, P13 (no raw PII to AI), T3

---

**2. Online research and execution plan:**

- Research:
  - INEC ward/constituency/LGA data structure in Nigeria (see INEC Act, geopolitical zone breakdown)
  - Nigerian political CRM patterns — outreach tracking, constituent management
  - AI in political communications — speech drafting, policy summary (note: HITL mandatory)
  - Ethical constraints on AI political content generation (Nigeria Electoral Act, INEC social media policy)
- Execution plan:
  - **Objective:** Register `politician` vertical; implement constituent CRM, ward coverage map, public profile, political event management, and HITL-gated AI speech drafting via SuperAgent
  - **Key steps** (numbered)
  - **Risks:** Political content sensitivity, identity verification integrity, NDPR on voter data

---

**3. Implementation workflow:**

Branch: `feat/vertical-politician` from `main`.

**3.1 Vertical registration:**
- `politician` in FSM registry; entity type: `individual`
- Lifecycle: `seeded → profile_pending → identity_verified → active`
- Required: NIN verification (from `packages/identity`)
- AI autonomy cap: L3 (HITL) for all political content generation

**3.2 Schema additions:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE politician_profiles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  vertical_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES verticals(id),
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  nin_verified INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  current_office TEXT,
  party_affiliation TEXT,
  constituency_id TEXT,
  lga_id TEXT,
  state_id TEXT,
  ward_id TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  photo_url TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE constituency_coverage (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  politician_profile_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES politician_profiles(id),
  ward_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  coverage_status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (coverage_status IN ('planned', 'active', 'completed')),
  agent_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**3.3 API routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/verticals/politician.ts`):
- `GET/PATCH /v/politician/profile` — profile management
- `GET /v/politician/wards` — list covered wards with agent counts
- `POST /v/politician/wards/:wardId/coverage` — update coverage status
- `GET /v/politician/events` — list political events (from community package)
- `POST /v/politician/ai/speech-draft` — HITL: SuperAgent drafts speech → stored as `pending_review` → returned to user for approval before publish (L3 autonomy)
- `POST /v/politician/ai/policy-summary` — SuperAgent summarizes policy document (not autonomous publish)

**3.4 AI feature governance:**
- All AI routes: `requireAiRights` + `requireNdprConsent('ai_usage')`
- Political AI content: must include `hitl_required: true` in usage event; content stored as draft (status: `pending_human_review`), never auto-published
- No AI call on USSD sessions (P12)

---

**4. QA and verification:**

Act as a **Senior QA Engineer** with civic tech and political software testing experience.
