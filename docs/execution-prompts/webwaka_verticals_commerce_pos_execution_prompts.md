# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Commerce + POS

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Commerce verticals (45 total) + POS Business Management System  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8b (POS Business) → M8e (remaining Commerce)  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about WebWaka's architecture, API contracts, or business logic. Always read the referenced documents and code first.
- **Research deeply** before executing. When encountering domain-specific patterns (POS reconciliation, restaurant inventory, market multi-vendor), do online research first.
- **Thoroughness is far more important than speed.** Spend extra time reading, planning, and validating.
- **All work must be pushed to GitHub.** No local partial work should remain outside the repo.
- **SuperAgent is the AI layer** — all AI features in verticals route through `packages/superagent` (SA Phase 1). Never call AI providers directly from vertical code.
- **3-in-1 pillar alignment required.** Every task block must declare its `primary_pillars` from `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md`. Every PR must be labeled with the correct `3in1:pillar-N` GitHub label. See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md`.
- **Platform Invariants are non-negotiable.** Read `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` in full before implementing any vertical.
- **The verticals FSM engine** in `packages/verticals/` governs lifecycle states. All verticals must use it — no custom state machines.

You are an expert **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** specializing in POS systems, retail operations software, and multi-tenant SaaS platforms, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- POS hardware and software architecture — agent networks, float management, terminal registration
- Inventory management systems — SKU, stock tracking, reorder alerts
- Nigerian fintech context — CBN agent banking guidelines, POS float reconciliation
- Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1 TypeScript strict
- WebWaka SuperAgent integration — AI features routing through `packages/superagent`
- Verticals FSM lifecycle states

---

**1. Mandatory context reading (100% before execution):**

Read and fully internalize ALL of the following before writing a single line of code:

- `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` — section on P1-Original verticals; POS Business entry; infrastructure requirements
- `docs/governance/verticals-dependency-dag.md` — POS Business dependencies (CAC, inventory schema, existing `packages/pos`)
- `packages/verticals/src/` — FSM engine, `registerVertical()`, lifecycle states (`seeded` → `active`)
- `packages/pos/` — existing float-ledger, agent terminal, POS infrastructure packages
- `infra/db/migrations/0023_pos_terminals.sql` and `0024_float_ledger.sql` — existing schema to build on
- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — how AI features connect to vertical workflows
- `docs/governance/ai-capability-matrix.md` — which AI capabilities are available for Commerce tier
- `docs/governance/superagent/02-product-spec.md` — AI tier requirements (which plan tier for AI features)
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P2 (Nigeria First), P9 (integer kobo), T3 (tenant isolation), T4 (kobo-only financial values)
- `docs/governance/entitlement-model.md` — subscription plan requirements for POS features
- `infra/db/migrations/0036_verticals_table.sql` — verticals table and `pos-business` seed entry

---

**2. Online research and execution plan:**

Once context is fully internalized:

- Research:
  - Best practices for POS inventory management (SKU tracking, low-stock alerts, dead-stock identification)
  - Nigerian agent banking architecture — CBN requirements for POS agent float management
  - AI applications in POS/retail: sales forecasting, reorder optimization, fraud flag
  - Multi-vendor POS systems (shared market context for future extension)
- Prepare execution plan:
  - **Objective:** Implement `pos-business` vertical — agent network management, inventory tracking, sales reporting, CRM, and AI-powered stock forecasting via SuperAgent
  - **Key steps** (numbered and ordered)
  - **Risks:** float reconciliation integrity, inventory count sync across agent terminals

---

**3. Implementation workflow:**

Branch: `feat/vertical-pos-business` from `main`.

**3.1 Vertical registration:**
- Register `pos-business` in `packages/verticals/src/registry.ts` with FSM lifecycle: `seeded → onboarding → kyc_pending → active → suspended`
- Vertical config: required KYC tier (CAC registration), required entitlement plan, allowed AI capabilities

**3.2 Schema additions** (new migration after 0036):
```sql
-- pos_business_profiles
CREATE TABLE pos_business_profiles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  vertical_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES verticals(id),
  business_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  cac_reg_number TEXT,
  cbn_agent_code TEXT,
  terminal_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  active_agents INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- pos_inventory_items
CREATE TABLE pos_inventory_items (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  tenant_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  sku TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  unit_price_kobo INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price_kobo > 0),
  stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0),
  reorder_threshold INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_pos_sku ON pos_inventory_items (workspace_id, sku);
```

**3.3 API routes** (`apps/api/src/routes/verticals/pos-business.ts`):
- `GET /v/pos-business/profile` — workspace profile
- `POST /v/pos-business/inventory` — add inventory item (P9: unit_price_kobo integer only)
- `GET /v/pos-business/inventory` — list with low-stock filter
- `POST /v/pos-business/inventory/:id/adjust` — stock adjustment with audit log
- `GET /v/pos-business/sales/summary?period=` — sales summary from float ledger
- `GET /v/pos-business/agents` — list registered agents for this workspace

**3.4 AI features** (route through SuperAgent — SA Phase 1 must be merged first):
- `POST /v/pos-business/ai/reorder-forecast` — sends recent sales data to `resolveAdapter()`, gets reorder recommendations; burns WC credits
- `POST /v/pos-business/ai/sales-summary-draft` — generates plain-English sales report from numeric data

AI routes must: check `requireAiRights` → check `requireNdprConsent('ai_usage')` → call `burnAndRecord()` → call AI → record `ai_usage_events`.

**3.5 Entitlement guards:**
- All POS routes: `requireAuth` + `requireKYCTier('cac_registered')`
- AI routes: additionally `requireAiRights` + plan tier `growth`

---

**4. QA and verification:**

Act as a **Senior QA Engineer** with POS systems and fintech testing experience.

**Test plan — `apps/api/src/routes/verticals/pos-business.test.ts`:**

Positive test cases:
- Inventory item created with correct integer kobo price (P9)
- Stock adjustment logged with before/after quantities
- Sales summary returns correct aggregated kobo values
- Agent list scoped to workspace (T3)

Negative / edge cases:
- Fractional kobo price rejected (T4 — P9)
- Stock adjustment below zero rejected
- Another tenant cannot access this workspace's inventory (T3)
- AI forecast blocked when `aiRights: false`
- AI forecast blocked when NDPR consent absent (P10)
- AI request on USSD session blocked (P12)

Security tests:
- Unauthenticated requests to all routes → 401
- Wrong KYC tier → 403

Minimum: 15 test cases.

**5. Finalize and push to GitHub:**

- Commit: `feat(vertical/pos-business): POS Business Management vertical — inventory, agents, AI forecasting (M8b)`
- PR description references: verticals master plan P1-Original section, platform invariants P9/T3/T4, AI integration framework, SuperAgent product spec
