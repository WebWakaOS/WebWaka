# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Agricultural + Place + Markets

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Agricultural verticals (12) + Place/Market verticals (8)  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8e (Priority 2 + 3 grouping)  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about Nigerian agriculture, food systems, or market operations. Always read referenced documents and code first.
- **Agricultural verticals are highly geography-dependent** — state/LGA/ward-level location is critical for farm profiles. Use `packages/core/geography` and the Nigerian 8-level geography hierarchy throughout.
- **Market verticals** (physical markets) involve multi-vendor operations — tenant isolation (T3) applies at both the market operator level AND individual vendor level.
- **All financial values in kobo** (P9, T4) — commodity prices, market levies, warehouse fees, storage charges.
- **USSD is the primary channel** for many agricultural field agents — AI features are excluded from USSD paths (P12). Design with offline/USSD-compatible data entry patterns (no AI) and web/WhatsApp AI features separately.
- **SuperAgent is the AI layer** — all AI routes through `packages/superagent`. Crop advisory AI is advisory only (L2 autonomy) — no autonomous planting or spraying recommendations.
- **3-in-1 pillar alignment required.** Every task block must declare its `primary_pillars` from `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md`. Every PR must be labeled with the correct `3in1:pillar-N` GitHub label. See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md`.
- **Platform Invariants are non-negotiable:** P2, P9, P10, P12, P13, T3.

You are an expert **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** with deep knowledge of Nigerian smallholder agriculture (NIRSAL, CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme, ADP extension services), crop management, and agricultural SaaS platforms, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- Farm profile management — crop types, acreage, LGA-level location
- Crop season and activity tracking — planting, crop care, harvesting schedules
- Input purchase tracking — seeds, fertilizer, agrochemicals (kobo P9)
- Commodity price tracking and offtake recording
- AI-powered crop advisory (L2 autonomy — advisory only, not autonomous action)
- USSD-friendly data entry patterns for field agents (AI excluded from USSD P12)

---

**1. Mandatory context reading (100% before execution):**

- `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` — Agricultural / Farm entry; category breakdown (P2 priority)
- `packages/core/geography/` — state → LGA → ward hierarchy; farm location must be LGA-level minimum
- `packages/payments/` — input purchase payment, produce sale payment
- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — agricultural AI use cases (crop advisory, market price intelligence)
- `docs/governance/ai-capability-matrix.md` — capabilities available at Growth tier
- `docs/governance/ai-agent-autonomy.md` — L2 autonomy for agricultural recommendations
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P2 (Nigeria First), P9 (kobo), P12 (USSD exclusion critical for farm field agents), P13, T3

---

**2. Online research and execution plan:**

- Research:
  - Nigeria crop calendar by geopolitical zone — planting/harvest seasons for maize, rice, sorghum, cassava, yam
  - Nigerian agricultural input market — NPK fertilizer, herbicide, hybrid seed prices (benchmark in kobo)
  - NIRSAL, BOA, CBN ABP loan program data requirements for farm loan application
  - AI crop advisory patterns — pest identification, disease alert, yield forecasting (Plantix, Hello Tractor patterns)
  - Offline-first farm data entry via USSD: numeric codes for crop types, activities — no AI on USSD (P12)
- Execution plan:
  - **Objective:** Register `farm` vertical; implement farm profile (LGA-located), crop season management, activity log, input purchase tracking, produce sale records, and AI crop advisory + yield forecast via SuperAgent (web/WhatsApp only, never USSD)
  - **Key steps** (numbered)
  - **Risks:** USSD field agents need offline data entry without AI; LGA-level geography dependency; commodity pricing volatility

Branch: `feat/vertical-tech-hub` from `main`.

**Schema:**
- `tech_hub_profiles` — hub_name, lga_id, hub_type (`coworking|incubator|accelerator|mixed`), capacity, wifi_speed_mbps, open_hours
- `hub_spaces` — hub_id, space_type (`hot_desk|dedicated_desk|meeting_room|event_space`), capacity, daily_rate_kobo, monthly_rate_kobo
- `hub_memberships` — member_ref, plan (`hot_desk|dedicated|private|virtual`), amount_kobo (P9), start_date, end_date, status
- `space_bookings` — space_id, member_ref, date, start_time, end_time, duration_hours, total_kobo, status
- `hub_cohorts` — hub_id, program_name, start_date, end_date, focus_area, startup_count
- `cohort_startups` — cohort_id, startup_ref, stage, sector, progress_notes

**API routes:**
- `GET/PATCH /v/tech-hub/profile`
- CRUD `/v/tech-hub/spaces`
- `POST/GET /v/tech-hub/memberships`
- `POST /v/tech-hub/bookings`
- `GET /v/tech-hub/bookings?date=&space=`
- `GET /v/tech-hub/revenue?period=` — membership + booking revenue in kobo
- CRUD `/v/tech-hub/cohorts`
- `GET/POST /v/tech-hub/cohorts/:id/startups`
- `POST /v/tech-hub/ai/member-matching` — SuperAgent: match new member to existing members by skill/sector
- `POST /v/tech-hub/ai/impact-report` — SuperAgent: draft program impact report from cohort data

---

**4. QA and verification:**

Minimum 14 test cases:
- Membership amounts in kobo (P9)
- Booking overlap validation (same space, same time → conflict)
- Revenue aggregation in kobo
- T3: bookings isolated per hub workspace
- AI member matching uses anonymized skills only (no real names — P13)
- AI blocked without consent (P10)

---

**5. Finalize and push to GitHub:**

- Commit: `feat(vertical/tech-hub): Tech Hub vertical — spaces, memberships, bookings, cohorts, AI member matching (M8e)`

## TASK V-AGR-AI: AI Feature Integration Across Agricultural Verticals

- **Module:** Cross-cutting AI for Agricultural category
- **GitHub context:**
  - AI integration framework: https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os/blob/main/docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md
  - SuperAgent prompts: `packages/superagent/src/prompts/agricultural.ts` (to be created)
  - Platform invariants: https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os/blob/main/docs/governance/platform-invariants.md (P12 critical)

---

You are an expert **Senior Platform AI Integration Engineer**, working on WebWaka OS.

**Skills required:**
- Agricultural domain AI prompting — Nigerian crop calendar context, geopolitical zone awareness
- USSD exclusion pattern (P12) — critical for agricultural field agents who use USSD
- Advisory-only AI framing (L2) — all agricultural AI must explicitly state it is advisory, not prescriptive

---

**1. Mandatory context reading:**

- `docs/governance/ai-integration-framework.md` — agricultural AI use cases
- `docs/governance/ai-agent-autonomy.md` — L2 advisory constraints for crop/livestock AI
- `docs/governance/platform-invariants.md` — P12 (USSD exclusion), P13 (no farm worker PII to AI)

---

**2. Research and execution plan:**

- Research: crop-specific prompting for Nigerian geopolitical zones (Southwest, Southeast, Northeast, etc.)
- Research: advisory framing patterns for AI crop recommendations (Plantix-style)
- Execution plan: shared agricultural AI utilities with zone-aware prompts and L2 advisory framing

---

**3. Implementation workflow:**

Create `packages/superagent/src/prompts/agricultural.ts`:
- `buildCropAdvisoryPrompt(crop: string, growthStage: string, lga: string, season: string): string` — includes Nigeria zone, rainy/dry season context; MUST include advisory disclaimer
- `buildYieldForecastPrompt(cropHistory: CropHistory[]): string`
- `buildMortalityAlertPrompt(dailyLogs: PoultryLog[]): string`
- `buildPriceForecastPrompt(commodity: string, region: string): string`

All prompts: include `[ADVISORY ONLY — consult your extension agent before acting]` disclaimer; no raw farmer names or NIN (P13); output in simple English with Pidgin option.

All functions in `packages/superagent/src/agricultural-ai.ts`:
- Mandatory USSD check (P12) before any call
- L2 autonomy framing in response metadata

---

**4. QA and verification:**

- USSD session → immediate error before any AI call (P12) — mandatory
- Advisory disclaimer present in all prompt outputs
- No PII in prompts (P13) — verified per function
- At least 10 test cases

---

**5. Finalize and push to GitHub:**

- Commit: `feat(superagent/agricultural): shared agricultural AI prompts with L2 advisory framing and USSD guard`
