# WebWaka OS — Verticals Execution Prompts: Creator + Professional + Financial + Media + Social

**Document type:** Agent execution prompt set  
**Scope:** Creator (8) + Professional (10) + Financial (5) + Media (4) + Social (3) verticals  
**Repo:** https://github.com/WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os  
**Branch base:** `main`  
**Milestone:** M8e  
**Status:** Ready for agent execution after SA Phase 1 pre-verticals are merged

---

> **3-in-1 Platform Note:**  
> Every vertical in this document serves at least **Pillar 1 (Ops)** and **Pillar 3 (Marketplace)**.  
> Verticals marked with Pillar 2 also require `apps/brand-runtime/` (implemented in PV-1.1).  
> **SuperAgent AI is cross-cutting — it is NOT a fourth pillar.** All AI features route through `packages/superagent`.  
> See `docs/governance/3in1-platform-architecture.md` for the full pillar map and `docs/governance/verticals-master-plan.md` for per-vertical classification.


### General rules for all agents using these prompts

- **Never make assumptions** about Nigerian creator economy, professional licensing, or financial regulations. Always read the referenced documents and code first.
- **Financial verticals carry CBN and SEC regulatory constraints.** Consult `docs/governance/ai-billing-and-entitlements.md` and `docs/governance/security-baseline.md` before implementing any financial vertical.
- **Professional verticals require license body verification** (MDCN, NBA, COREN, ICAN, etc.) — use `packages/identity/` patterns.
- **Creator and Social verticals** are heavy users of `packages/social` — read it thoroughly.
- **All AI routes through SuperAgent** — never call providers directly. Media/creator verticals may use multimodal capabilities — check tier requirements in capability matrix first.
- **All financial values in kobo** (P9, T4) — professional fees, savings, premiums, commissions.
