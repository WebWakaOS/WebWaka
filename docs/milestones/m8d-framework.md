# M8d — Civic Expansion: Church / NGO / Cooperative

**Status:** Planning — Blocked by M8a, Parallel to M8b/M8c/M8e
**Author:** Replit Agent (M8 Planning)
**Date:** 2026-04-09
**Duration:** 5 days
**Prerequisite:** M8a complete

---

## Goal

Implement all P1-Original civic verticals (Church, NGO, Cooperative) and their P3 relatives (Mosque, Youth Organization, Women's Association, Ministry/Mission). Leverage M7c community platform as the shared foundation.

---

## Verticals in Scope (6)

| Vertical | Slug | Entity Type | P1? | IT Reg | Community |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Church / Faith Community | `church` | organization | ✅ P1 | Yes (IT-XXXXXXXX) | Yes |
| NGO / Non-Profit | `ngo` | organization | ✅ P1 | Yes (IT-XXXXXXXX) | Yes |
| Cooperative Society | `cooperative` | organization | ✅ P1 | CAC | Yes |
| Mosque / Islamic Centre | `mosque` | organization | P3 | Yes (IT-XXXXXXXX) | Yes |
| Youth Organization | `youth-organization` | organization | P3 | Yes | Yes |
| Women's Association | `womens-association` | organization | P3 | No | Yes |
| Ministry / Apostolic Mission | `ministry-mission` | organization | P3 | Yes | Yes |

---

## Key Infrastructure Note

**M7c Community Platform is COMPLETE and covers 80% of civic vertical needs:**
- `community_spaces` — congregation/member space
- `community_channels` — announcements, prayer requests, programs
- `community_courses` — Sunday school, Bible study, training programs
- `community_events` — services, crusades, fundraisers, AGM
- `community_members` with `tier` — free/paid membership tiers
- Moderation — content governance

**M8d adds the vertical-specific overlay** — registration verification, compliance tracking, and sector-specific features.

## Sample Vertical: Church / Faith Community (Full Implementation)

### Market Research
- Nigeria: 100,000+ registered churches (RCCG, MFM, Winners, Anglican, Catholic, etc.)
- Pentecostal density: Lagos (18,000+), Abuja (5,000+), Enugu, Port Harcourt
- Global megachurches with Nigerian origins: RCCG (50M+ members globally)
- Pain points: member management, tithe tracking, attendance, event coordination

### Top 15 Features
1. Church profile with CAC IT number + denomination
2. Community space for congregation (M7c — channels, courses, events)
3. Service schedule (Sunday, mid-week, special programs)
4. Member directory (congregation management)
5. Tithe + offering collection (Paystack)
6. Donation tracking per member (tax-deductible receipts)
7. Prayer request management + pastoral follow-up
8. Announcement broadcasts (WhatsApp + Telegram + SMS)
9. Bible study / discipleship courses (M7c course module)
10. Youth / children's ministry sub-groups
11. Evangelism / outreach team management
12. Anniversary / crusade event ticketing
13. Multi-branch / satellite campus management
14. Pastoral staff workspace + delegated roles
15. Livestream integration (YouTube / Facebook embed)

### FSM
```
seeded → claimed → it_verified → community_active → active
```

Transitions:
| From | To | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `seeded` | `claimed` | `requireKYCTier(1)` + phone verified |
| `claimed` | `it_verified` | `verifyCAC_IT()` via `packages/identity` |
| `it_verified` | `community_active` | Community space created |
| `community_active` | `active` | First service event published |

### New Schema (Migration 0040)

```sql

## AI Integration — SuperAgent Requirements (added 2026-04-13)

All AI features in this milestone use `packages/superagent`. Do not import `packages/ai-abstraction` directly in vertical code.

For each AI feature in M8d:
1. Complete Section 13 of `docs/templates/vertical-ai-research-template.md` — declare capability set and autonomy level
2. Set `hitl_required: true` for any feature with autonomy level L3 or above
3. See `docs/governance/superagent/04-execution-roadmap.md` for the Phase 2 vertical integration checklist
[ ] docs/verticals/cooperative-brief.md complete
