# WebWaka OS

## Overview

WebWaka OS is a multi-tenant, multi-vertical, white-label SaaS platform operating system for Africa, starting with Nigeria. It follows a governance-driven monorepo architecture with "Offline First," "Mobile First," and "Nigeria First" as core principles.

**Current State: PRODUCTION READY — Staging + Production deployed green, 2463 tests passing, TypeScript 0 errors, 10/10 governance checks green**
**Backlog tracking: `docs/ops/implementation-plan.md` — phases P1–P25 defined**
**Notification Engine — Final Master Specification: `docs/webwaka-notification-engine-final-master-specification.md` (2,303 lines, 15 deliverables, N-001–N-130 backlog, 20 guardrails, 13 open questions — supersedes both source documents)**
**Notification Engine Review: `docs/notification-engine-review.md` (superseded — see final master spec)**
**Notification Engine Audit: `docs/notification-engine-audit.md` (superseded — all 20 corrective actions incorporated into final master spec)**

## Production Readiness Mission — COMPLETE (2026-04-19)

### Deep Code Review Findings (2026-04-19)

**Security — SOLID (no P0/P1 vulnerabilities found)**
- Tenant isolation (T3): SQL queries in all repositories enforce `WHERE tenant_id = ?`
- Auth: JWT validated, dual-layer token revocation (blacklist + JTI hash), session tracking
- Rate limiting on all auth endpoints (login, register, password reset, invite)
- Body size limits, CSRF protection, secure headers — all applied globally
- Email verification enforcement on financial routes (bank-transfer, B2B marketplace)
- USSD exclusion on all AI routes (P12 compliance)
- Audit logging on all mutation paths
- `requireEntitlement` enforced on politician, transport, civic, commerce, superagent routes

**P2 Finding — requireRole middleware added at router level:**
`/partners/*` and `/platform/analytics/*` relied solely on per-handler `super_admin` checks.
Added `requireRole('super_admin')` middleware at the Hono router level as defense-in-depth.
New file: `apps/api/src/middleware/require-role.ts`

**P2 Finding (flagged for owner) — Commerce P2/P3/extended routes:**
Routes `/auto-mechanic/*`, `/bakery/*`, `/api/v1/artisanal-mining/*` etc. (60+ verticals)
use `authMiddleware` only; no `requireEntitlement(PlatformLayer.Commerce)` check.
T3 (tenant isolation) is still enforced at the SQL level. This may be intentional
(free-tier access to basic vertical management) or an oversight.
**Owner must confirm:** Should these verticals require the Commerce plan entitlement?

**P3 — OpenAPI spec coverage:**
`apps/api/src/routes/openapi.ts` covers core platform routes but not vertical routes (~75% undocumented).
Not a security or functionality issue — affects API discoverability for external integrators.

### Deployment Status

- **SUPER-ADMIN**: Seed super-admin account in production D1
- **GH-VARS**: Set `STAGING_BASE_URL` + `PRODUCTION_BASE_URL` GitHub variables
- **GH-SECRETS**: Set `STAGING_SMOKE_JWT`, `STAGING_SMOKE_SUPER_ADMIN_JWT`, `SMOKE_API_KEY` (real key)
- **DNS-CUTOVER**: Point `api.webwaka.com` to the Cloudflare Worker production endpoint
- **ENTITLEMENT-CONFIRM**: Confirm whether Commerce P2/P3 verticals should require plan entitlement

## Comprehensive QA Audit — Bug Log (April 2026)

### FIXED BUGS

| ID | Severity | Description | File |
|----|----------|-------------|------|
| BUG-001 | CRITICAL | Migration 0087 used wrong table (`phone_accessories_stock`), wrong columns (`cac_or_trade_number`, `location_cluster`), missing job statuses (`diagnosing`, `awaiting_parts`), wrong column name (`fault` → `fault_description`) | `infra/db/migrations/0087_vertical_phone_repair_shop.sql` |
| BUG-002 | MEDIUM | TypeScript non-null assertion on `advisory_data[0]` without type guard in test | `apps/api/src/routes/verticals/phone-repair-shop.test.ts:166` |
| BUG-003 | HIGH | Rollback script dropped wrong table (`phone_accessories_stock` instead of `phone_repair_parts`) | `infra/db/migrations/0087_vertical_phone_repair_shop.rollback.sql` |
| BUG-004 | LOW | 10 verticals use old `/ai/prompt` stub pattern without `aiConsentGate` (all `planned` status, no PII processing yet) — fix in Phase 13 | `abattoir`, `agro-input`, `cassava-miller`, `cocoa-exporter`, `cold-room`, `creche`, `fish-market`, `food-processing`, `palm-oil`, `vegetable-garden` |
| BUG-005 | CRITICAL | 8 route files never mounted in any aggregator router — completely unreachable in production | `ngo`, `sole-trader`, `road-transport-union`, `produce-aggregator`, `community-radio`, `insurance-agent`, `savings-group`, `tech-hub` |
| BUG-006 | CRITICAL | `verticals-edu-agri-extended.ts` (14 routes) never imported or mounted in `router.ts` — all 14 routes unreachable | `apps/api/src/router.ts`, `verticals-edu-agri-extended.ts` |
| SCRIPT-001 | LOW | `check-ndpr-before-ai.ts` checked `index.ts` instead of `router.ts` (stale after ARC-07 split) | `scripts/governance-checks/check-ndpr-before-ai.ts` |
| SCRIPT-002 | LOW | `check-pillar-prefix.ts` didn't accept `[Infra/Pillar N]` hybrid prefix format | `scripts/governance-checks/check-pillar-prefix.ts` |
| AUTH-001 | CRITICAL | `POST /auth/register` missing — workspace-app register page returned 404; implemented self-service tenant+workspace+user creation with PBKDF2-600k | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` |
| AUTH-002 | MEDIUM | `POST /auth/forgot-password` missing — password reset initiation broken; implemented with KV TTL storage | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` |
| AUTH-003 | MEDIUM | `POST /auth/reset-password` missing — password reset completion broken; implemented with KV token validation | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` |
| AUTH-004 | HIGH | `/auth/login` returned `{ token }` only; frontend expected `{ token, user }` — user was always undefined after login until page refresh | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` |
| AUTH-005 | HIGH | `/auth/me` returned `{ data: { userId } }` (nested, wrong field names); frontend expected `{ id, email, tenantId, role }` — tenantId always showed `—` | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` |
| AUTH-006 | HIGH | `tryRefresh` sent token in POST body — `/auth/refresh` reads from Authorization header; refresh always failed causing immediate re-login on any 401 | `apps/workspace-app/src/lib/api.ts` |
| AUTH-007 | MEDIUM | `setRefreshToken(res.refreshToken)` stored literal string `"undefined"` in localStorage on login (refreshToken didn't exist in response) | `apps/workspace-app/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` |
| AUTH-008 | MEDIUM | `LoginResponse` type declared non-existent `refreshToken` field; `LoginResponse['user']` missing `workspaceId` needed by Dashboard/Offerings/POS | `apps/workspace-app/src/lib/api.ts` |
| WS-001 | HIGH | Dashboard used hardcoded `DEMO_STATS` — no real data; connected to `/billing/status` + `/pos-business/sales/:workspaceId/summary` | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` |
| WS-002 | HIGH | Offerings used `setTimeout` stub for save/delete/toggle — data not persisted; connected to `/pos-business/products` CRUD | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Offerings.tsx` |
| WS-003 | HIGH | POS used `DEMO_PRODUCTS` + `setTimeout` for checkout — no real transactions; connected to `/pos-business/products` load + `/pos-business/sales` | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/POS.tsx` |
| COVERAGE-001 | HIGH | `auth-routes.ts` had zero test coverage; added `auth-routes.test.ts` with 36 tests (login, register, me, refresh, verify, forgot-password, reset-password, change-password, NDPR erasure) | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.test.ts` |
| QA-18-001 | CRITICAL | No `ResetPassword.tsx` page existed — email reset link hit 404; user had no way to complete the reset flow | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx` (new), `App.tsx` |
| QA-18-002 | HIGH | No rate limit on `POST /auth/register` — open to spam account creation | `apps/api/src/router.ts` (added 5/15min limit) |
| QA-18-003 | HIGH | No rate limit on `POST /auth/forgot-password` — KV could be flooded | `apps/api/src/router.ts` (added 5/15min limit) |
| QA-18-004 | MEDIUM | `ForgotPassword.tsx` said "expires in 15 minutes" but backend TTL is 3600s (1 hour) | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx` |
| QA-18-005 | MEDIUM | Settings "Change password" form called a `setTimeout` stub — no API call made; no `POST /auth/change-password` endpoint existed | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts`, `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Settings.tsx` |
| QA-18-006 | LOW | `/offerings/new` route rendered the list view without opening the "Add offering" modal | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Offerings.tsx` (checks location.pathname) |
| QA-18-007 | LOW | Settings "Sign out of all devices" label was misleading (only clears localStorage) | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Settings.tsx` (label corrected) |
| P19-A | HIGH | `POST /forgot-password` generated tokens but never sent emails; `password-reset` template missing from EmailService | `apps/api/src/lib/email-service.ts` (template added), `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` (EmailService wired) |
| P19-B | HIGH | Settings profile "Save changes" was a setTimeout stub; no `PATCH /auth/profile` endpoint; GET /auth/me returned only 5 fields | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` (PATCH /auth/profile + extended GET /auth/me), `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Settings.tsx`, `apps/workspace-app/src/lib/api.ts` |
| P19-C | HIGH | No server-side logout; token blacklisting only happened on refresh; client just cleared localStorage | `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` (POST /auth/logout + KV blacklist + session cleanup), `apps/workspace-app/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (async logout), `apps/workspace-app/src/lib/api.ts` |
| P19-D | MEDIUM | No Playwright E2E tests for reset-password page, forgot-password flow, change-password, or NDPR erasure UI | `tests/e2e/workspace/auth-flows.e2e.ts` (new — 18 tests) |
| P19-E | MEDIUM | Dashboard showed `—` for Commerce metrics on free plan with no explanation; free-plan users had no upgrade path from the main screen | `apps/workspace-app/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (upgrade banner + locked metric labels) |
| P19-F | LOW | No tenants table — tenant_id was a bare string with no corresponding DB record; multi-tenant admin dashboard had nothing to query | `infra/db/migrations/0230_init_tenants.sql` + rollback, `apps/api/src/routes/auth-routes.ts` (tenants insert in register batch) |

### BUG-005/006 RESOLUTION — Complete Route Mounting Restoration

After fixes, all 132 vertical route files are mounted. The following router files were updated:
- `verticals-civic-extended.ts` — added `ngo`
- `verticals-transport-extended.ts` — added `road-transport-union`
- `verticals-edu-agri-extended.ts` — added `produce-aggregator`
- `verticals-financial-place-media-institutional-extended.ts` — added `community-radio`, `insurance-agent`, `savings-group`, `tech-hub`
- `verticals-commerce-p3.ts` — added `sole-trader`
- `router.ts` — imported `eduAgriExtendedRoutes`, added auth middleware for all 22 newly reachable routes, mounted edu-agri router at `/api/v1`

- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (typecheck + test + lint + audit + governance)
- **Staging Deploy:** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` (D1 migrations → API deploy → smoke tests)
- **Production Deploy:** `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` (staging validation gate)
- **Target:** Cloudflare Workers (autoscale)

## Important Invariants for All Agents

- **Auth pattern:** `c.get('auth')` → `{ userId, tenantId, workspaceId? }`; NEVER decode JWT manually
- **T2:** TypeScript strict mode everywhere. `any` requires a comment explaining why.
- **T3:** Every query on tenant-scoped data includes `tenant_id`. No exceptions.
- **T4/P9:** All monetary values stored as **integer kobo** (NGN × 100). No floats.
- **T5:** Feature access gated by entitlement check via `@webwaka/auth`.
- **T6:** Discovery driven by `@webwaka/geography` hierarchy — no raw string matching.
- **T7:** Claim lifecycle enforced by `packages/claims/src/state-machine.ts`.
- **AI routes:** All `/:id/ai-advisory` routes MUST use `aiConsentGate` middleware (NDPR P13).
- **Old AI stubs:** 10 verticals use `/ai/prompt` stub pattern (no PII processed) — upgrade in Phase 13.
- **Router registration:** ARC-07 split — ALL routes registered in `apps/api/src/router.ts`, NOT index.ts.
- **Route mounting:** All 132 vertical routes MUST appear in a verticals aggregator router AND that router MUST be imported + mounted in router.ts.
- **App count:** 9 apps (NOT 7).
- **Repo URL:** `https://github.com/WebWakaOS/WebWaka` (NOT `WebWakaDOS/webwaka-os`).

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Vertical Route Pattern (new, P11+)
```typescript
// Named export from route file
export const myVerticalRoutes = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>();
// OR default export
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>();
export default app;

// FSM transition guard — ALWAYS synchronous (mockReturnValue, NOT mockResolvedValue)
const g = guardSeedToClaimed({ kycTier: body.kycTier });
if (!g.allowed) return c.json({ error: g.reason }, 403);

// AI advisory route — ALWAYS gated with aiConsentGate
app.get('/:id/ai-advisory', aiConsentGate as MiddlewareHandler<...>, async (c) => {...});

// Double-findProfileById pattern in transition handlers
const current = await repo(c).findProfileById(id, tenantId); // get current state
await repo(c).transition(id, tenantId, to);
const updated = await repo(c).findProfileById(id, tenantId); // return updated state
return c.json(updated);
```

### Vertical Router Aggregator Pattern
```typescript
// In verticals-[category]-extended.ts
import myRoutes from './verticals/my-vertical.js'; // default import
import { myNamedRoutes } from './verticals/my-other-vertical.js'; // named import
router.route('/my-vertical', myRoutes);

// In router.ts — BOTH auth middleware AND route mount required:
app.use('/api/v1/my-vertical/*', authMiddleware);
app.route('/api/v1', myRoutes); // via the aggregator
```

## Notification Engine Review (2026-04-20)

Deep code-first platform-wide review of all notification infrastructure completed.
Authoritative specification saved to `docs/notification-engine-review.md` (1,838 lines, 11 deliverables).

**Key findings:**
- EmailService exists (Resend, 6 templates) but hardcodes FROM as `WebWaka <noreply@webwaka.com>` — never tenant-branded
- OTP delivery is solid (Termii/Meta WA/360dialog/Telegram) but not unified with notification pipeline
- Webhook outbound exists (4 types) but inline-blocking retry, no Cloudflare Queues backing
- @webwaka/events has 16 event types but in-memory subscriber lost on Worker restart — no notification handlers wired
- 160+ vertical packages produce zero notifications
- Zero: notification inbox, preference model, notification templates, push, digest, dead-letter, escalation

**Deliverables in docs/notification-engine-review.md:**
1. Platform Review Method (all repos, confidence levels)
2. Current-State Findings (code-grounded, repo-by-repo)
3. Canonical Event Catalog (80+ events across all domains, with status: EXISTS/PARTIAL/MISSING)
4. Missing Elements List (architecture, product, data model, governance, observability)
5. Canonical Domain Model (13 new D1 tables with full schema)
6. Reference Architecture (full pipeline from domain action → outbox → queues → rule engine → preference → brand context → template render → dispatch → inbox → dead-letter → audit)
7. Template System Design (40+ template families, channel constraints, inheritance hierarchy, versioning)
8. Repo-by-Repo Implementation Impact (all apps + packages)
9. 8-Phase Roadmap (~150 engineering days)
10. 15 Best-Practice Guardrails (G1–G15)
11. Actionable Backlog (N-001 through N-118)
